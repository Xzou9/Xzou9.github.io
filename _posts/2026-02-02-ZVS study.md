title: The ZVS and voltage spike
---
The Zvs is important swithcing technology.
We all know that ZVS is worked by the lagging current , which decrease the turn on loss. 
But what is leading what is lagging. Sometimes is still confusing. 
Here is the defination:

 The lagging current usually is caused by the inductor:
we could list the example of the turn on the up mos in the half bridge:
The lagging current could push the electrons in to the parallel capacitor of the voltage sources, and when we turn on , it did not have the voltage and current over lapping.
